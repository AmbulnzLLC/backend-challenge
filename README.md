Challenge for Backend Developer
===============================

To better assess a candidate's development skills, we would like to provide the following challenge. This is intended to be developed in a pair programming session within an hour of time.
It's allowed to use documentation and online resources.

Prerequisites
-------------

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)

Option one
* [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [nodejs framework of your choice](i.e. https://loopback.io)

Option two
* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org)
* [Ruby rameworks of your choice](i.e. http://www.ruby-grape.org)

Installation
------------

Clone the project

```bash
git clone git@github.com:AmbulnzLLC/backend-challenge.git && cd backend-challenge/
```

Generate a nojdes or ruby project. You can add libraries of your choice, but be ready to describe them.

**Please set up up your working environment before the interview (working nodesjs or Ruby, MySQL)
so we don't spend time installing anything.**

Project description
-------------------

**Pizzeria**

The application serves the purpose of ordering pizza online.

The following entities should be created (including proper relations):

* *pizza type* - has a name and price (e.g. Margherita $5, Pepperoni $6, ...)
* *order* - has items
* *order item* - has a pizza type and quantity

On the homepage, list of orders with total prices should be shown.

On a "Create Order" screen, the user can select pizza types and amounts, add to the order, see current total, and place (save) the order.

Additionally, the following JSON API should be provided:

* list of orders
* details of an individual order

Optional features:

* meaningful model validations (e.g. item amount > 0)
* order bonuses (e.g. 5% cheaper when total over $50, 10% cheaper when total over ...)
* authentication
* tests
* whatever interesting you'd like to do

Evaluation
----------

Our goal is to find answers to those questions:

* Do you understand the chosen stack, framework, and MVC pattern in general?
* Can you design interfaces that are clear and easy to use?
* Do you master your working environment?

Due to the limited time consider the following:

* It is not important to have a fully functional application at the end
* The goals might shift during the interview as we discuss the work flow
* The front-end does not have to be beautiful

Levels of functionality:

* **basic** - items mentioned in description work
* **above average** - some optional features
* **exceptional** - getting tests to continuously build, deploy to heroku, etc.
